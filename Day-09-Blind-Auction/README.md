# Day 9 - Blind Auction 💰🕵️‍♂️

Secret blind auction program where multiple bidders enter their name and bid amount privately.

The program:
- Keeps taking bids until no more bidders
- Clears the screen between entries (for secrecy!)
- Announces the winner with the highest bid at the end

## What I Learned
- Dictionaries (key-value storage for bidders)
- Nested dictionaries/lists
- While loops with flags
- Clearing console screen (os module)
- Finding max value in dictionary
- Building a multi-user interactive program

## How to Run
Run `main.py` 
→ Enter name and bid  
→ Type 'yes' or 'no' for more bidders  
→ Highest bidder wins!

## Example
Kanye bids high and crushes everyone 😂

Took a little help from Claude 4.5 Sonnet on one part — but got it working perfectly. One of the most fun projects yet!
