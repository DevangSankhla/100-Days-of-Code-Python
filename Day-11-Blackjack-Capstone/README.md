# Day 11 - Blackjack Capstone 🃏🎰

Full-featured Blackjack game following casino rules:
- Dealer hits until 17
- Player can hit/stand multiple times
- Aces handled as 11 or 1 automatically
- Win/lose/bust detection
- ASCII art cards and logo
- Play again option

## What I Learned
- Lists for deck/hand management
- Complex conditional logic
- Functions for dealing, calculating scores, comparing hands
- Global variables and scope basics
- Building a complete, polished game from scratch

## How to Run
Run `main.py`
→ Get dealt cards  
→ Choose hit or stand  
→ Beat the dealer without busting!

Built with **ZERO external help** — course calls me an expert now 😂  
One of the proudest projects in the challenge.
