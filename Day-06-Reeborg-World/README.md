# Day 6 - Escaping the Maze 🤖

Solution to the Reeborg's World challenges (Hurdles, Maze, etc.) using functions and while loops.
All challenges completed on the Reeborg platform.

## What I Learned
- Functions with parameters
- While loops and indefinite loops
- Complex conditionals
- Problem-solving through trial & error (3+ hours on this one!)

Note: Code written for https://reeborg.ca — can't run locally, but logic is fully here.

Proudest project so far — felt impossible at first.
