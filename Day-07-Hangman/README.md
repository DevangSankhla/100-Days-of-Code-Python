# Day 7 - Hangman 🎯

Fully playable Hangman game with word list, lives system, and ASCII art stages.

## What I Learned
- Lists and string manipulation
- While loops with break conditions
- Functions for repeated logic
- Debugging complex flow (took multiple hint watches!)
- Building a complete small game from scratch

## How to Play
Run `main.py` → Guess letters → Try not to get hanged!
