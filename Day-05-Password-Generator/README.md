# Day 5 - Password Generator 🔐

Generates a strong random password based on user-specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
Easy → Hard levels available.

## What I Learned
- For loops and range
- List methods (append, extend)
- Random module (choice, shuffle)
- Converting list to string
- Taking multiple inputs and type conversion

## Example Output
Want 8 letters, 4 symbols, 4 numbers?  
→ Something like: `J}aW%kP!2@mL$9#x`
