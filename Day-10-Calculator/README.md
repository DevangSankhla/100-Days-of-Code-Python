# Day 10 - Calculator 🧮

A fully functional calculator program that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
- Chaining operations (e.g., 3 + 5 × 6 = 48)
- Continue calculating with previous result
- Restart option
- Clean ASCII logo

## What I Learned
- Functions that return values
- Recursion (calling function inside itself for restart)
- Dictionaries with functions as values
- Advanced user input handling
- Building a practical real-world tool

## How to Run
Run `main.py`
→ Enter first number  
→ Choose operation (+ - × ÷)  
→ Enter next number  
→ Continue or start new calculation

Super proud — built this with ZERO external help (just one Claude suggestion for better UX). One of my favorite projects!
